//** Introduction
// This code implements the ACT update code. It does not use a mutex. This code uses
// a platform service (_plat__ACT_UpdateCounter()) that returns 'false' if the update
// is not accepted. If this occurs, then TPM_RC_RETRY should be sent to the caller so
// that they can retry the operation later. The implementation of this is platform
// dependent but the reference uses a simple flag to indicate that an update is
// pending and the only process that can clear that flag is the process that does the
// actual update.
