MS-IoT fTPM
===========
## Trusted firmware for Windows based AArch32 (32-bit) ARM SoC's
Please see the [build-firmware document](https://github.com/ms-iot/imx-iotcore/blob/develop/Documentation/build-firmware.md) in the iMX IoT Core repo for additional information on including this TA in an IoT Core image for iMX boards.

## Included TAs

### fTPM TA
The fTPM Trusted Application (TA) provides a secure firmware implementation of a TPM using the MS reference implementation.
Platform specific code is copied and modified locally in [`optee_ta/fTPM/platform`](./optee_ta/fTPM/platform), while [`/fTPM/reference`](./fTPM/reference) contains files to support WolfSSL, control the fTPM's functionality, and define basic types, which may not be found in OpTEE.

See the reference implementation for more details.

## Extra Installation Steps

The secure firmware utilizes the OP-TEE implementation of the Global Platform specifications. The OP-TEE project is
not duplicated in this repository but is obtained directly from the public release. The build of OP-TEE is based on a
native Linux build, however the following installation steps allow OP-TEE to be built under Windows using WSL. Only the optee_os
repository is relevant for trusted firmware use - the optee_client & optee_linuxdriver repositories are integration
components for Linux and can serve as a reference for the Windows equivalent components. Note that optee_linuxdriver
is GPL.

OpTEE generates a build environment for trusted applications which is based on Make (See TA_DEV_KIT_DIR in the build directions).
This build environment places several constraints on how the code is organized, which are explained in the relevant makefiles.
See the [optee_os documentation](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/documentation/build_system.md) for details about how OpTEE build works.

#### 1. Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux
See instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10):

#### 2. Launch Bash
Search for "bash" in the start menu, OR press Windows key + 'R', then type bash.
Update if needed.

In WSL:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

#### 3. Install the ARM tool chain
Install the ARM toolchain to a directory of your choice.
```sh
cd ~
wget https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/6.4-2017.11/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-6.4.1-2017.11-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
tar xf gcc-linaro-6.4.1-2017.11-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
rm gcc-linaro-6.4.1-2017.11-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
```

#### 4. Clone the OpTEE OS source code
If you do not already have a version of the OP-TEE OS repo cloned on your machine you may run:
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ms-iot/ms-iot-optee_os.git
```

#### 5. Build OP-TEE OS for the target platform

`TA_CROSS_COMPILE` should point to the ARM toolchain installed in [step 3](#3-install-the-arm-tool-chain).

```sh
cd ~/optee_os
CROSS_COMPILE=~/gcc-linaro-6.4.1-2017.11-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf- make PLATFORM=imx-mx6qhmbedge CFG_TEE_CORE_LOG_LEVEL=4 CFG_REE_FS=n CFG_RPMB_FS=y CFG_RPMB_TESTKEY=y CFG_RPMB_WRITE_KEY=y -j20
```
Additional information on Microsoft IoT fork of OP-TEE OS can be found [here](https://github.com/ms-iot/ms-iot-optee_os).

#### 6. Clone the ms-tpm-20-ref source code
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ms-tpm-20-ref.git
```

#### 7. Initialize the git submodules
```sh
cd ~/ms-tpm-20-ref
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Building the TPM

#### 1. Build the Firmware TPM Trusted Application
`TA_CROSS_COMPILE` should point to the ARM toolchain installed in [step 3](#3-install-the-arm-tool-chain).

`TA_DEV_KIT_DIR` should point to the directory the optee_os TA devkit was compiled to in [step 5](#6-clone-the-ms-tpm-20-ref-source-code
).

`-j` increases the parallelism of the build process.

```sh
cd ~/ms-tpm-20-ref/Samples/ARM32-FirmwareTPM/optee_ta
TA_CPU=cortex-a9 TA_CROSS_COMPILE=~/gcc-linaro-6.4.1-2017.11-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf- TA_DEV_KIT_DIR=~/optee_os/out/arm-plat-imx/export-ta_arm32 CFG_TEE_TA_LOG_LEVEL=2 make -j20
```
Debugging options you may want to add:

`CFG_TEE_TA_LOG_LEVEL=3` 1 is fatal errors only, other values increase debug tracing output.

`CFG_TA_DEBUG=y` Turns on debug output from the TAs, and enables extra correctness checks in the fTPM TA.

#### 2. Measured Boot support
The fTPM Trusted Application includes support for Measured Boot. This feature allows the TA to read a TPM Event Log compatible with the specification in Section 5 of the
[TCG EFI Protocol Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/EFI-Protocol-Specification-rev13-160330final.pdf). The event log is read and extended during the TA initialization.

Measure Boot support requires OpTEE System Call ```PTA_SYSTEM_GET_TPM_EVENT_LOG```, available since [OpTEE 3.10.0](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/tree/3.10.0).

Flags related to Measured Boot support:

`CFG_TA_MEASURED_BOOT`: Controls whether Measured Boot is enabled (`CFG_TA_MEASURED_BOOT=y`) or disabled (by default).
`CFG_TA_EVENT_LOG_SIZE`: Maximum size in bytes allowed for the Event Log. Defaults to 1024 bytes.
